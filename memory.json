This failure to return the expected data format prevents any analysis from being performed.\n\n### Recommended Action\n\nTo get the product analysis, the underlying connection and execution error must be resolved first:\n\n1.  **Check MCP Server Status:** Ensure the MCP server is running, accessible, and correctly configured.\n2.  **Review Tool Output:** Investigate why the `product_info` tool is returning an error object instead of the expected data string.\n\nOnce the MCP server connection is stable and the tool is functioning correctly, please retry your request.",
